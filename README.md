🎥🐑 Counting Sheep with AI: Transforming livestock farming!

I recently worked on a project using YOLO11 to count sheep automatically on farms. The system tracks each sheep and provides the total count. This technology eliminates the need for manual counting, saving time and effort while ensuring accurate livestock management.

💡🎯 Key Benefits:
✅ No need to count sheep manually anymore—saving time and effort for farmers.
✅ Enhances efficiency and accuracy in livestock management on sheep farms.

AI is truly making farm life smarter and more efficient!
